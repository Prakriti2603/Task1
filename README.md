# Task1
Phase 1: Project Setup
Create a Folder: On your desktop, create a new folder named Elevate_Task1.


Open in VS Code: Open VS Code and drag your new folder into it.


Create Files: Create two new files exactly named index.html and style.css.

Phase 2: The Code (HTML & CSS)
Use the structure required by your internship task:


HTML: Include a <header> with a logo, a <nav> with links, a Hero Section with a heading and CTA button, and a <footer>.


CSS: Use Flexbox or Grid for the layout. Ensure you include a Media Query (e.g., @media (max-width: 600px)) so the layout stays responsive on mobile.

Phase 3: Run and Test

Install Live Server: Click the Extensions icon in VS Code, search for Live Server, and click Install.


Go Live: Open index.html, right-click the code, and select "Open with Live Server".

Phase 6: Final Submission
